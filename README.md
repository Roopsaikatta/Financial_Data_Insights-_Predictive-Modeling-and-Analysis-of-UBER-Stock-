1. Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting stock prices using historical financial data. The goal is to forecast the closing price of the stock 2 years into the future using linear regression. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and prediction.

2. Data Collection and Preparation
2.1. Data Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

Date: The date of the stock data entry.
Open: The stock price at the opening of the trading day.
High: The highest price of the stock during the trading day.
Low: The lowest price of the stock during the trading day.
Close: The stock price at the close of the trading day.
Adj Close: Adjusted closing price accounting for corporate actions.
Volume: The number of shares traded.
profit: Difference between Close and Open.
2.2. Data Cleaning
Handling Missing Values: Checked for missing values and addressed them if present.
Data Types: Converted date strings to datetime objects for time series analysis.
Feature Engineering: Created additional features such as Days, which represents the number of days since the start date.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3.1. Descriptive Statistics
Summary statistics were calculated for key features:

Open: Mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
Close: Mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
Volume: Mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
3.2. Visualization
Time Series Plot: Visualized the stock price trends over time.
Correlation Matrix: Analyzed correlations between different features.
Scatter Plots: Examined relationships between Open and Close prices.
4. Linear Regression Analysis
4.1. Model Training
Features: Used Days as the feature for predicting the Close price.
Training and Testing: Split data into training and testing sets.
4.2. Model Evaluation
Coefficients:
Intercept: The value of Close when Days is zero.
Coefficient: Indicates the change in Close price with each additional day.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Evaluated the model performance on the test set.
5. Prediction
5.1. Future Prediction
Future Date Calculation: Calculated the date 2 years from the start of the dataset.
Prediction: Estimated the stock price 2 years into the future using the linear regression model.
6. Visualization of Results
6.1. Regression Line and Predictions
Actual vs. Predicted: Plotted actual vs. predicted closing prices and included future predictions.
Future Prediction Highlight: Added a marker for the predicted future stock price and a vertical line indicating the prediction date.
7. Conclusion
The project successfully utilized linear regression to predict stock prices based on historical data. While the linear model provides a basic forecast, more advanced models and additional features may improve accuracy. The prediction suggests the stock price will trend according to the historical patterns observed in the data.

8. Limitations and Future Work
Data Limitations: The analysis is based on historical data and may not account for future market changes.
Model Limitations: Linear regression may not capture all complexities of stock price movements.
Future Work: Consider incorporating more features, such as economic indicators or market sentiment, and using more sophisticated models like time series analysis or machine learning algorithms.
